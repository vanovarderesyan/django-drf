The Johannesburg Society of Advocates (JSA) on Monday informed advocate Dali Mpofu SC he had been found guilty of violating Rule 4.12 of the General Council of the Bar's Uniform Rules of Ethics for telling advocate Michelle le Roux SC to shut up in a Zondo Inquiry hearing.Rule 4.12 requires advocates who are representing clients who have ill-feeling towards each other to not allow that conflict to impact on their conduct towards each other.While the JSA has given Mpofu five days to make representations about his possible punishment, his letters to it strongly suggest he is considering a legal challenge to the finding made against him.The Johannesburg Society of Advocates (JSA) has found senior counsel Dali Mpofu guilty of an ethical violation for telling advocate Michelle le Roux to shut up during a heated exchange at the State Capture Inquiry.""It  is indisputable that … you used intemperate language vis-à-vis Le Roux SC by telling her to shut up, whether directly or indirectly,"" the JSA stated in a letter sent to Mpofu on Monday, adding this had occurred ""in proceedings of national importance and received immense publicity"".It has now given Mpofu five days to ""provide written submissions in respect of an appropriate sanction"" before its Professional Committee (ProfCom) reaches a decision on his possible punishment.But is already apparent Mpofu is considering bringing a legal challenge to the JSA finding made against him.That finding is based on a 21-page report by advocate Michael Kuper SC on the March 2021 altercation between Mpofu and Le Roux, who were respectively representing former SA Revenue Service commissioner Tom Moyane and his political nemesis, Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan, at the commission.Moyane had successfully applied to cross-examine Gordhan and, as that hearing dragged on into the night, tensions between Mpofu, Gordhan, Le Roux and even then-Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo became increasingly apparent.ALSO READ | Chief Justice interviews: Dali Mpofu to be probed for 'possible misconduct' – Legal Practice CouncilThe situation imploded when Mpofu objected to Le Roux asking Gordhan how he felt about being referred to as a racist by Moyane. Mpofu became visibly upset when Le Roux then attempted to explain the reasons behind her question.""Chair, I am on the floor. Really I can't stand this,"" Mpofu said. ""This cannot be happening for the third time. Ms Le Roux must shut up when I am speaking, okay?""When a shocked Gordhan exclaimed ""Yhoooo"", Mpofu hit back with: ""You too, Mr Gordhan. I am still on the floor, may you also shut up."" During the altercation, Zondo repeatedly asked Mpofu to sit down while he listened to Le Roux's explanation for her question - and the advocate repeatedly refused to do so.""But why must I sit down?"" Mpofu asked Zondo.Zondo: ""I want to hear the explanation, then I will hear you.""Mpofu: ""Chair, I am still speaking, why must I sit down?""Zondo then reiterated to Mpofu he was in charge and again asked the advocate to sit down.""I will hear her [Le Roux] and then I will hear you,"" he told Mpofu.Mpofu responded: ""Chair, maybe then we should leave because if we are not allowed to speak … and you allow interruptions…""Despite his objections, Mpofu eventually did sit down, as Le Roux attempted to persuade Zondo he should give Gordhan ""the opportunity to explain to you and to the country quite frankly how he feels as a person when he is accused of being a racist by Mr Moyane"". Zondo refused her request.According to Kuper's report, Mpofu maintained he had not told Le Roux ""directly to shut up but used the third person in the course of addressing the commissioner which"", he said, made the remark ""even more harmless and benign"".Mpofu admitted he had told Gordhan to shut up because ""he rudely and improperly intervened verbally while the debate among the lawyers and the chair was ensuing"".READ | Gordhan vs Mpofu: Heated exchanges on arrogance, jealousy and racism didn't help - ZondoHe added this was in the context ""of a long line of condescending and insulting remarks from him to me, which had all gone unchastised and unaddressed"".A few days after the highly publicised altercation, Zondo publicly condemned Mpofu's conduct during his interaction with Le Roux as unacceptable and added he had ""never heard any lawyer in any court proceedings or any commission forum tell another lawyer to shut up. Or a witness"".No legal practitioner, including Mr Mpofu, has a right to begin to tell any other person in this commission to shut up … even I would not use the words shut up. That conduct is unacceptable to this commission, and it is important that the public and other legal practitioners should know that this conduct is not acceptable in this commission.Zondo added: ""Where everyone or anyone can stand up and tell other people in the proceedings to shut up and not rather request the chairperson to ask the other person to please keep quiet while they speak, if that is allowed, then there will be chaos in proceedings of this commission and that, I will not allow. Irrespective of who does it.""Last year, Mpofu told the JSA's ProfCom that Zondo's statement in response to his conduct was built on allegations that were ""unfounded, defamatory and otherwise unlawful"". The advocate is, however, now facing a separate Legal Practice Council unprofessional conduct investigation in relation to his treatment of the recently appointed Chief Justice.In his address on the shut up saga, Zondo also pointed out that Rule 4.12 of the General Council of the Bar's Uniform Rules of Ethics required that advocates who represented antagonistic clients should not allow that antagonism to influence their treatment of each other.EXCLUSIVE | Dali Mpofu must be charged says legal body after ‘shut up’ outburstUnder the heading ""Ill-feeling and Personalities between Counsel"", rule 4.12 states that: ""Clients, not counsel, are the litigants. Whatever may be the ill-feeling existing between clients it should not be allowed to influence counsel in their conduct and demeanour towards each other or towards suitors in the case. ""All personalities between counsel should be scrupulously avoided. In the trial of a cause it is improper to allude to the personal history or the personal peculiarities and idiosyncrasies of counsel on the other side. Personal colloquies between counsel which cause delay and promote unseemly wrangling should also be carefully avoided.""It is that rule that Kuper found Mpofu had violated. While Mpofu had accused Le Roux of racism, Kuper found there was ""nothing at all to show that Le Roux had any racial motivation, and that imputation should be rejected"".""Her conduct as a whole was not above criticism but I do not believe that it amounts to professional misconduct,"" he added.Mpofu, who is soon to be replaced as Advocates for Transformation's representative at the Judicial Service Commission, is unlikely to face any serious sanction as a result of the JSA's finding against him. He has, however, already told the society he was assessing his legal options in relation to the guilty finding made against him.Your opinion matters to us.
